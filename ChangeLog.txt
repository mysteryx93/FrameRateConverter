Version 1.2.1 (2018-05-12)
- Slightly improved quality. Added sharp=1 and rfilter=4 to MSuper.

Version 1.2 (2017-09-02)
- Mask strength now adjusted to produce similar artifacts masking with different DCT values
- Removed Stripes parameter as Skip isn't practical
- Added Stp parameter, whether to detect and blend stripes
- Changed MaskTrh default from 100 to 120
- Changed BlendOver default from 65 to 70
- If NewNum is twice the clip's frame rate, set FrameDouble to true by default to preserve source frames


Version 1.1 (2017-09-01)
- Added InterpolateDoubles function to replace double frames with interpolated frames using FrameRateConverter
- Added DctRe parameter to specify DCT for MRecalculate
- DCT now also applied for MRecalculate by default
- Preset Normal now uses DCT=4 for MRecalculate. Old Normal is now Fast and old Fast is now Faster.
- Presets Slow and Slower also now use DCT=4 for MRecalculate
- SkipOver default treshold increased from 120 to 210
- BlendOver default treshold increased from 60 to 65
- SkipOver now specified for thSCD2 of MMask. Previously, scene changes would cause 2 adjacent frames to be skipped. Specifying thSCD2 causes only 1 frame to be marked for scene change.
- Updated Avisynth headers in DLL
- StripeMask: renamed trh parameter to thr
